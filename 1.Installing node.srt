00:12.380 --> 00:13.370
- [Instructor] Hello everyone.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.010
In this lesson I'm going to explain

00:15.010 --> 00:17.430
what is node.js, and we're going to install it.

00:18.410 --> 00:20.950
But first let's review the client-server model.

00:23.500 --> 00:25.850
In a typical web app there are two parts,

00:26.070 --> 00:27.540
the server and the client.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.150
The server is the central part

00:30.170 --> 00:32.320
that executes the most important tasks.

00:33.140 --> 00:36.640
On the other hand, the clients are the people or devices

00:36.860 --> 00:38.910
that your use your app through a browser.

00:38.970 --> 00:41.160
For example, the client can be running

00:41.430 --> 00:44.220
from a computer or from a smart phone

00:44.760 --> 00:46.960
or from multiple computers at the same time.

00:47.660 --> 00:49.660
The client can also execute code.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.120
For example, you can add some JavaScript code

00:53.260 --> 00:54.760
to be used by the client.

00:55.100 --> 00:57.340
For example, maybe you have already down that;

00:57.340 --> 01:00.550
used JavaScript to create interactive websites

01:00.550 --> 01:01.500
in the client site.

01:02.510 --> 01:04.530
The idea of node.js is different.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.470
Node.js is an engine that allows you to write

01:08.500 --> 01:10.960
server-site code using JavaScript.

01:11.650 --> 01:14.240
So, Node.js will run inside a server

01:14.550 --> 01:16.550
but you can execute code using it

01:16.950 --> 01:18.750
and this code will be in JavaScript.

01:19.810 --> 01:22.190
The idea is that you write your JavaScript code,

01:22.190 --> 01:24.710
and the engine executes the code in the server.

01:25.330 --> 01:26.380
Now let's install it.

01:26.730 --> 01:29.550
First, open the Node website like I've done here.

01:30.270 --> 01:32.820
Here you can load a version of the engine

01:32.820 --> 01:34.070
for our operation system.

01:34.590 --> 01:35.520
I'm using Windows.

01:35.780 --> 01:38.180
So I will download an installer for it.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.120
If you're using Linux or Mac,

01:40.410 --> 01:42.360
you can download a pre-compiled binary.

01:43.390 --> 01:46.010
There are two options, the LTS here.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.410
This is recommended for most users

01:49.700 --> 01:51.250
and is the most stable version.

01:51.550 --> 01:54.300
This is the version we are going to use in this course.

01:55.070 --> 01:57.280
And we also have the Current version,

01:57.960 --> 01:59.410
which is the most recent one.

01:59.730 --> 02:01.160
It has the newest features,

02:01.450 --> 02:03.030
but it might have some bugs,

02:03.160 --> 02:05.540
so we are going to stick to the LTS version.

02:06.150 --> 02:10.020
I've already installed the Node.js engine in my computer,

02:10.020 --> 02:11.620
so I'm not going to do it again.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.370
But if you don't have it installed in your computer,

02:14.370 --> 02:16.190
so please pause the video now,

02:16.440 --> 02:19.580
download the version for your operation system,

02:19.580 --> 02:20.440
and install it.

02:21.030 --> 02:23.270
After you install it you can test it

02:23.360 --> 02:25.390
if it's working correctly by running it.

02:25.930 --> 02:27.450
If you're using Linux or Mac,

02:27.850 --> 02:29.390
you can go to the binary folder,

02:29.390 --> 02:31.030
you have downloaded from the site,

02:31.030 --> 02:33.480
and just execute the binary in the terminal.

02:34.690 --> 02:37.340
You can also execute it through the Windows terminal,

02:37.370 --> 02:39.080
and that's what you're going to do to here.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.860
So, open here, and we can run, for example, Node.

02:44.450 --> 02:46.750
This should execute the Node engine.

02:47.710 --> 02:50.900
However, the Windows terminal, it doesn't support

02:50.900 --> 02:52.250
Unix-like command lines.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.640
At the time of this recording,

02:54.750 --> 02:57.500
it has been announced a new batch terminal for Windows.

02:57.860 --> 02:58.860
But in the meantime,

02:59.000 --> 03:01.410
you can download a free git batch terminal,

03:01.660 --> 03:02.680
for example, this one.

03:02.680 --> 03:04.420
You can access gitforwindows.org

03:04.950 --> 03:07.230
and download a git batch terminal.

03:07.670 --> 03:12.560
So it provides you a terminal with Unix-like commands.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.800
You can see it should look like this.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.540
And then here you can use Unix-like commands lines.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.493
Lines here.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.890
And you can also use git commands.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.290
But in this course,

03:25.290 --> 03:29.460
I'm going to use the full Windows terminal,

03:29.460 --> 03:31.210
but you can use the one you prefer.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.380
As you can see, here I'm running the Node engine.

03:34.760 --> 03:35.810
And after running it,

03:36.050 --> 03:37.700
you can run any JavaScript code.

03:37.800 --> 03:42.330
For example, let's create "hello world" messages.

03:43.650 --> 03:44.850
Here it is, hello world.

03:45.310 --> 03:46.143
So it's working.

03:46.143 --> 03:48.490
Now we know it's working,

03:48.560 --> 03:49.660
but in the real world,

03:50.130 --> 03:52.820
we want to write our JavaScript code in a separate file,

03:52.820 --> 03:55.980
and not right in here inside of the engine itself.

03:56.620 --> 03:59.100
And that's what you're going to do in the next lesson.

03:59.100 --> 04:01.740
Where we are going to create out Hello World using Node,

04:01.740 --> 04:04.590
but adding the Hello World in a separate JavaScript file.

Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.960
Welcome to the Phaser 3 RPG course.

3
00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.300
In this course, we are going to build an RPG game

4
00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.820
with Phaser 3, including several features.

5
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.610
First of all, we're going to use the Firebase framework

6
00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.141
for authentication and online storage.

7
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:17.946
This way, we can authenticate players

8
00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:19.940
with their Google account,

9
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.840
and save the progress during the game.

10
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.750
The game will have many of the common aspects of RPGs

11
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.750
such as NPCs, items, equipments, a pause screen,

12
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.184
and enemies to battle.

13
00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:36.400
We're going to develop a turn-based battle system

14
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.820
with elements to select actions and targets.

15
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.540
Most of the assets used in this game

16
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.110
are from a pack called superpowers asset pack.

17
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.240
This pack is available through GitHub,

18
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.034
and it is under the Creative Commons Zero license,

19
00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:54.790
which means you can use them in your own games.

20
00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.050
Now, let's move to the next lessons,

21
00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:58.973
where we are going to actually start building our game.
